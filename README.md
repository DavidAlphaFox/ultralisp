## What is this?

This is a fast-moving Common Lisp software distribution for those who
want to publish his/her software today instead of waiting for the next
month.

<a id="how-to-use-it"></a>

## How to use it?

To use it, open your Lisp `REPL` and eval:

```lisp
(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.ultralisp.org/" :prompt nil)
```
Pay attention, that Quicklisp's client does not support `HTTPS` yet.
Vote for [this issue][4b9d] on the
GitHub, to increase priority for this feature.
